# Architecture

`fleet` has one core and several front-ends. The core knows how to find Claude Code sessions on a
machine, drive them, manage tmux sessions and reach other machines. The CLI, the TUI dashboard and
the web app are views on top of it.

## Components

### Core library (`crates/fleet/src/core`)

Pure logic plus thin process wrappers; no printing. Everything a future front-end needs is here:

- **discovery** — builds the list of live sessions (see [below](#session-discovery)).
- **backend** — per-backend control: read the screen, type text, press keys, focus, spawn.
  - tmux: `capture-pane -p -J`, `send-keys -l <text>` + `Enter` (multi-line text: `load-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p`, since `send-keys -l` drops newlines), `new-session` / `new-window`.
  - iTerm: AppleScript via `osascript`; values are passed as argv, never interpolated into the
    script. Text is written without a newline, then an empty write submits it (a trailing newline
    would be swallowed by bracketed paste).
- **naming** — generates short kebab-case titles by asking `claude -p --model haiku` what a
  session is working on (falls back to git branch / first prompt); cached across runs.
- **tmux** — tmux-*session* management inherited from `ws`: matching, sanitizing, stale detection.
- **config** — reads and patches the shared config file.
- **hosts** — resolves the target host and dispatches over ssh.
- **tools** — binary lookup (`PATH` plus Homebrew fallbacks), `~` expansion.
- **brief** / **stack** — the [session brief](#session-briefs) and [session stack](#session-stacks)
  files: format, merge rules, storage.
- **snapshot** — [session recovery](#session-recovery): records what runs, marks it dormant after
  a reboot, restores it.

### CLI and TUI

`crates/fleet/src/cli` parses arguments and renders text or JSON; `crates/fleet/src/tui` is the
`watch` dashboard (ratatui). Neither contains discovery or backend logic.

### Host dispatch

Every command has a target host: `-H/--host <name>`, else `FLEET_HOST`, else a default
(`defaultHost` for tmux-session commands, this machine for everything else). `--local` forces the
local machine.

- target == `self` → run locally;
- otherwise → `ssh <hosts.<name>.ssh> fleet <same args>`.

The remote runs `fleet --local <args>` (so it never hops again), found as `hosts.<name>.fleetBin`,
then `~/.local/bin/fleet`, then `PATH` (with `FLEET_CMD`/`FLEET_DEBUG`/`FLEET_DRY_RUN` exported, never
`FLEET_CONFIG`) — install it with `fleet install --host <name>`. ssh is
invoked with a connect timeout (`FLEET_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, default 5 s), keepalives and ControlMaster
multiplexing (off with `FLEET_MUX=0`); a tty (`-t`) is requested when both stdin and stdout are
terminals, otherwise `-T` with `BatchMode`. Directory arguments under `$HOME` are rewritten to `~/…`
so they resolve on the remote. An ssh failure (exit 255) becomes a friendly message and exit code 4.
`FLEET_DRY_RUN=1` prints what would run.

There is no chained hopping: a host dispatches only to hosts in its own config.

### Web server (`web/`)

Every machine runs the same `server.mjs`. It:

- serves the static UI, installable as a PWA: the React app built to `web/ui/dist/`
  (`fleet web build`; until then `/` is a "not built" placeholder);
- exposes **its own** sessions, discovered with `fleet list --json` (cached ~2 s);
- drives its own backends directly for peek/send/keys (it needs untruncated, header-free output);
- reads chat transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`;
- for the whole-fleet view, fetches each peer's local list over HTTP and merges.

Requests for another host are proxied once to that peer with `?local=1`, and requests carrying
`?local=1` are never proxied again, so there are no loops. Either machine's URL shows everything.

The server has no auth; it relies on the network (tailnet) for access control. The files
endpoints (chat file links → preview) therefore only serve paths that, after `realpath`, are
inside that host's `$HOME` or the session's cwd, and never secret stores like `~/.ssh` or `.env`.

## Config

One JSON file per machine, owned by the CLI (`fleet init`, `fleet config set`) and read by the web
server. Path: `$FLEET_CONFIG`, else `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/fleet/config.json`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "self": "laptop",
  "defaultHost": "workstation",
  "hosts": {
    "laptop":      { "ssh": null,          "web": "http://100.x.y.z:7777" },
    "workstation": { "ssh": "workstation", "web": "http://100.x.y.z:7777" }
  },
  "web":  { "port": 7777, "bind": "0.0.0.0", "dir": null },
  "tmux": null,
  "spawnDirs": [
    { "label": "Project", "paths": { "laptop": "~/Code/project", "workstation": "~/Code/project" } }
  ]
}
```

| key | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `self` | which `hosts` entry this machine is |
| `defaultHost` | target for tmux-session commands when no `-H` is given |
| `hosts.<name>.ssh` | ssh destination (an `~/.ssh/config` alias or `user@host`); `null` for `self` |
| `hosts.<name>.web` | that host's web server URL; hosts without one are not web peers |
| `web.port` / `web.bind` | web server listen address; with no config at all it binds `127.0.0.1` only |
| `web.dir` | where the web app lives (repo checkout or install dir), detected by `init` |
| `web.node` | `node` binary that runs the web app; `null` → `/opt/homebrew/bin/node`, `/usr/local/bin/node`, then `PATH` |
| `web.editor` | `"vscode"` (default) \| `"cursor"` \| `null`: the scheme of the "Open in editor" link the API puts on briefs and session rows (`editorUrl`, see [Session briefs](#session-briefs)); `null` = no link (the UI hides the button) |
| `web.editorSsh` | ssh destination other machines use for **this** host in those links (e.g. the alias in the laptop's `~/.ssh/config`); default `<user>@<the hostname the browser used>` |
| `web.ui` | static UI directory to serve instead of the bundled one; unset → `web/ui/dist`. The old `"classic"` value (the removed vanilla UI) is ignored |
| `web.quickReplies` | composer chips: strings or `{ label, text }` |
| `web.models` | New session model picker: `[{ id, label }]` or bare ids (`""` = Claude's default, no `--model`); default Default, Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5 |
| `web.autoName` | `{ enabled, intervalMinutes }` (default off, 5 — opt in with `enabled: true`): the web server runs `fleet name --all --apply` on its host on that schedule (tmux names follow the titles, see [Session titles](#session-titles)); a web spawn with a first prompt also gets a targeted `fleet name <id> --apply` once it has replied |
| `web.grouping` | `{ enabled, intervalMinutes }` (default off, 10): this host's web server runs `fleet group` over the whole fleet on that schedule and serves `/api/groups` (see [Smart grouping](#smart-grouping)) |
| `web.uploads` | `{ dir, maxMB, retentionDays }` (default `~/.local/share/fleet/uploads`, 100, 14): files dropped / pasted / picked in the web UI are stored there on the session's host as `YYYY-MM-DD/<rand>-<name>`, and their absolute path goes into the prompt; day dirs older than `retentionDays` are removed (`0` keeps them) |
| `web.briefs` | `{ enabled, model, idleMs, minIntervalMs, maxDeltaChars, maxCallsPerHour, minNewTurns, minNewChars, maxBriefChars }` (default off, `haiku`, 60 s, 15 min, 12000, 12, 2, 2000, 3000): background generation of [session briefs](#session-briefs) on this host; reading and editing briefs (and a manual regenerate) work either way |
| `web.stacks` | `{ syncMinutes }` (default 2): how often this host's web server runs `fleet stack sync` while any of its sessions is in a [stack](#session-stacks) |
| `web.notes` | `{ root, name?, searchCmd?, exclude? }` (default off): the web UI's notes explorer (`#/notes`) over the markdown notes under `root` on this host — browse, full-text search (built in, or an external `searchCmd` such as `rg -n -i -F {query}`), preview with `[[wiki]]` / relative links between notes; hidden entries, `node_modules`, `.gitignore`d paths and age-encrypted blocks are never served (web/ARCHITECTURE.md → notes). Peers browse each other's notes through the usual proxy |
| `web.files.roots` | array of dirs (`~` expanded, default `[]`): extra roots a relative file path in chat may be under. A relative path missing under the session cwd first matches files the session touched (from its transcript), then ancestors of those, then these roots; the sandbox stays `$HOME` + cwd |
| `desktop.url` | the server [Fleet.app](desktop.md) opens instead of `hosts.<self>.web`; unset → this machine's server |
| `tmux` | tmux binary; `null` → `PATH`, then `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin` |
| `hosts.<name>.fleetBin` | path to `fleet` on that host; `null` → `~/.local/bin/fleet`, then `PATH` |
| `fleetBin` | this machine's `fleet` binary (used by the web server) |
| `claude` | command that launches Claude Code in spawned sessions (default `claude`) |
| `spawnDirs` | directories offered for new sessions, per host (`paths.<host>`); also edited from the web UI (Settings → Start directories, which writes it through `fleet config set`) |
| `tui` | dashboard preferences: `rows` (`"1"`, `"2"`, `"auto"`), `mouse` |
| `naming` | generated names: `enabled`, `model` (default `haiku`), `syncTmux` (tmux name follows the title, default on), `autoTitle` |
| `stacks` | [session stacks](#session-stacks): `enabled` (default `true` — `false` = never call the model; a new stack gets the skeleton StackBrief), `model` (default `sonnet`) |
| `restore` | [session recovery](#session-recovery): `onBoot` (default `false`) — when `true`, this host's web server runs `fleet --local restore --all` once at start if there are dormant sessions, at most once per boot (it remembers the boot id in `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/fleet/web-restored-boot`); the result is logged. For an always-on machine. Recently closed sessions are never part of it. `keepClosedDays` (default `7`, a number ≥ 0; `0` turns the [recently closed](#recently-closed) list off) — how long a session closed within a boot stays restorable; at most the newest 50 are kept |
| `repos` | [`fleet repos`](cli.md#repos), per machine: `roots` (default `["~/Code"]`; every directory directly under a root with a `.git` is a repo), `every` (default `"24h"`; `30m` / `12h` / `7d`), `overrides` (`{ "<dir name or ~/path>": "30m" }`), `exclude` (dir names or `~/` paths). Read leniently: a bad value is a warning and falls back to its default |
| `grouping` | smart grouping: `enabled` (default `true` — `false` = repository fallback only), `model` (default `haiku`), `host` (the one host whose web server runs it; peers proxy `/api/groups` there), `consolidateMinutes` (default 60) |

Rules: `~` is expanded at use time; unknown keys are preserved when the CLI rewrites the file
(writes go through the raw JSON, never the typed view); a missing file is fine — this machine is
the single host `local`, and remote features say "run `fleet init`"; a present but invalid file is
an error.

Env overrides for the web server: `FLEET_WEB_PORT` (or `PORT`), `FLEET_WEB_BIND`, `FLEET_WEB_UI`,
`FLEET_WEB_AUTONAME`, `FLEET_WEB_GROUPING`, `FLEET_WEB_BRIEFS`, `FLEET_BRIEFS_DIR`, `FLEET_STACKS_DIR`, `FLEET_BIN`, `FLEET_TMUX` — see [web/README.md](../web/README.md).

## Session discovery

Claude Code keeps a live registry: one `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` per running interactive
session with its session id, cwd, name, status (`busy` / `idle` / `waiting`) and what it waits for.
That is the source of truth; `fleet` enriches each entry:

1. **pid → tty** via `ps`.
2. **tty → terminal**: match against `tmux list-panes -a` (pane id, window name, tmux session) and,
   on macOS, iTerm's sessions (session id, tab title). The match decides the **backend**
   (`tmux` / `iterm` / `unknown`) and the **handle** used to control it (tmux pane id like `%87`,
   or the iTerm session id).
3. **titles** from the naming cache (never generated by `list` itself).

Headless runs (`claude -p`, SDK and CI entrypoints) register too and are filtered out.

Targets (`peek <target>`, `send <target>` …) resolve against title, name, session-id prefix or pid,
walking exact → prefix → substring → characters-in-order; two matches on the same rung is an error
listing the candidates, so a loose fragment can never type into the wrong session.

## Session titles

One title per session, one source of truth (`core::title`):

- **The Claude session name is the truth.** `/rename` sets it and Claude persists it in its
  session registry (`name`, `name_source: "user"`).
- **`display_title`** is derived once, in core, and shipped in `list --json`: the Claude name when
  someone chose it (`name_source` ≠ `derived`), else the generated title (`gen_title`), else a
  slug of the first prompt, else Claude's derived `<cwd>-9d` name, else the short session id / pid.
  The CLI, TUI and web UIs draw only this; the tmux name is at most metadata (details panel, the
  TUI's terminal column).
- **The tmux session name is derived**: a slug of the title (lowercase kebab, common Latin
  accents folded, ≤ 48 chars), `-2`, `-3`… on a collision; a name already derived from the title
  (with or without its suffix) is left as is. It is synced on **every** rename — `fleet rename`,
  `fleet name --apply` (auto-naming), the TUI rename buffer, the web UI — but only when the tmux
  session is that Claude session's own: one window, one pane. Shared sessions, `fleet` and the
  dashboard's own session are left alone, with a note saying so. `naming.syncTmux = false` or
  `--no-tmux-sync` opts out.
- **Reverse edge**: `fleet tmux rename` of a single-Claude tmux session renames the Claude session
  (and so the title); raw `tmux rename-session` is not watched and is overwritten the next time the
  title changes. Auto-naming never clobbers a hand-picked tmux name: a derived-name session alone in
  a non-generic tmux session (not `fw-hhmmss`, digits or `<cwd>-xx`) adopts that name as its title.
- **iTerm** tab titles are not touched: Claude already puts its session name in the terminal title,
  and a tab title set by hand is the user's.
- **When `/rename` may be typed**: `/rename <title>` + Enter goes into the live Claude TUI. A
  session **waiting** on a permission prompt or question is held (the keys would answer it; `--force`
  overrides). A **busy** session is renamed: Claude Code runs `/rename` as a local command the moment
  it is submitted, mid-turn, and the turn carries on untouched (verified live; an older Claude that
  queues input would run it after the turn). Nothing is queued by fleet — a held rename is refused
  with a message and retried by the caller. Known gap: text half-typed into the session's prompt
  box would be prefixed to `/rename`.

## JSON contracts

These are stable APIs — the web app, scripts and future UIs depend on them. Add fields freely;
never rename, remove or change the type of an existing one without a version bump.

### `fleet list --json`

An array of sessions; every row carries `host` (the name the *caller's* config knows that machine
by — with no config, `local`):

| field | type | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pid` | number | Claude process id |
| `session_id` | string \| null | Claude session UUID |
| `name` | string \| null | Claude session name |
| `name_source` | string \| null | `"derived"` = Claude's cwd+hash fallback |
| `cwd` | string \| null | working directory |
| `status` | string | `busy` \| `idle` \| `waiting` \| `unknown` |
| `waiting_for` | string \| null | what a `waiting` session is blocked on |
| `updated_at` | number \| null | last status change, ms since epoch |
| `tty` | string \| null | |
| `backend` | string | `tmux` \| `iterm` \| `unknown` |
| `handle` | string \| null | tmux pane id or iTerm session id |
| `tab` | string \| null | tmux window name / iTerm tab title |
| `tmux_session` | string \| null | tmux session the pane lives in |
| `title` | string \| null | first prompt (can be long) |
| `gen_title` | string \| null | generated title, if cached |
| `display_title` | string | **the** title every view draws — see [Session titles](#session-titles) |
| `context` | object \| null | context-window usage (below); `null` when no transcript usage is found |
| `stack` | object \| null | `{ id, label }` of the [session stack](#session-stacks) the session is a member of; `null` when none (read-only stamp: `list` never syncs or writes stack files) |
| `host` | string | which machine the row came from |

`list --all-hosts --json` is the same array across every configured host.

#### Context usage

`context` is `{ used, window, pct, model }`, computed in `core::context` from the tail of the
session's transcript (`~/.claude/projects/<cwd with / and . as ->/<session_id>.jsonl`, falling
back to a scan of the project dirs when the session's cwd changed):

- **`used`** (number): prompt tokens of the **last main-thread assistant entry** with real usage —
  `input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens`. Sidechain (subagent)
  entries, API-error entries, `<synthetic>` and all-zero usage are skipped. Output tokens are not
  counted (the same sum Claude Code's statusline context percentage uses); the reply is counted as
  input on the next turn.
- **`window`** (number): `200000` or `1000000`, inferred — transcripts don't record it. 1M when the
  model id ends in `[1m]`, when the model is natively 1M in Claude Code without a suffix (every
  Fable and Mythos, Opus / Sonnet 5.5 and later), when `used` already exceeds 200k, when `settings.json` pins a `[1m]`
  model of that family, when Claude Code's `~/.claude.json` has recorded that exact model id as
  `<id>[1m]`, or when another live session on the same model id is past 200k without a suffix
  (the model is natively 1M). Otherwise 200k — so a 1M session under 200k with none of these
  signals over-reports its percentage.
- **`pct`** (number): `round(used / window * 100)`; can exceed 100.
- **`model`** (string \| null): `message.model` of that entry.

### Subscription usage

`fleet usage --json` (and the web's `GET /api/hosts/:host/usage`, which adds `host`) reports the
Claude subscription limits of the account logged in to Claude Code on that machine, from
`core::usage`:

```json
{
  "account": { "uuid": "…", "email": "…", "organization": "…", "plan": "max", "tier": "default_claude_max_5x", "plan_label": "Max 5x" },
  "limits": [
    { "kind": "session", "group": "session", "label": "Current session", "model": null, "percent": 18.0, "severity": "normal", "resets_at": "2026-09-29T22:20:00+00:00", "active": false },
    { "kind": "weekly_all", "group": "weekly", "label": "Weekly · all models", "model": null, "percent": 38.0, "severity": "normal", "resets_at": "…", "active": true },
    { "kind": "weekly_scoped", "group": "weekly", "label": "Weekly · Fable", "model": "Fable", "percent": 37.0, "severity": "normal", "resets_at": "…", "active": false }
  ],
  "extra_usage": { "enabled": false, "used": 0.0, "limit": null, "currency": "USD", "percent": 0.0 },
  "fetched_at": "2026-09-29T20:00:00+00:00",
  "stale": false,
  "error": null
}
```

- **Source**: the plan-usage endpoint Claude Code's `/usage` calls (`GET
  https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`), authenticated with Claude Code's OAuth access
  token — the macOS keychain item `Claude Code-credentials`, else `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
  The endpoint is undocumented: its generic `limits` list is used when present, the named windows
  (`five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_sonnet`) otherwise. `curl` makes the
  request, with the token on stdin (never in argv). The token is never refreshed (that would
  rewrite Claude Code's credentials): an expired one is an error until Claude Code runs again.
- **`account`**: from `~/.claude.json` (`oauthAccount`) and the credentials' `subscriptionType` /
  `rateLimitTier`; `null` when unknown. The web groups hosts by `account.uuid`, so machines on one
  subscription share one card.
- **`limits[].active`**: the limit currently binding. `severity` is the endpoint's (open set:
  `normal`, `warning`, …); `percent` may exceed 100.
- **Caching**: `~/.claude/fleet-usage.json` holds the last good read and the last failure. A read
  younger than 60s is served from it; after a failure the last good read comes back with
  `stale: true` and `error`, and the endpoint isn't asked again for 2 minutes. With no good read
  at all, the command fails (exit 1) with the reason.

Only the tail is read (256 KiB, widened to 2 MiB then 8 MiB if no usable entry is in it), and the
result is cached in-process per `(path, size, mtime)`, so the `watch` dashboard re-reads a
transcript only after it has grown. Views colour `pct` in the same bands: under 60 dim, 60–85
amber, over 85 red.

### `fleet group --json`

See [cli.md](cli.md#grouping) for the shape. State file: `groups.json` (below).

### `fleet tmux list --json` / `fleet tmux stale --json`

See [cli.md](cli.md#tmux-sessions) for the shapes. `tmux list --json` lists live sessions only;
dormant ones are in `fleet restore --json`.

### `fleet restore --json`

`{ host, bootId, dormant: [DormantView…] }`, and the restore / forget results — see
[cli.md](cli.md#session-recovery) for the shapes and [Session recovery](#session-recovery) for the
state file behind them.

### Web API

JSON over HTTP, errors as `{ "error": "..." }`. At a high level:

| method | path | purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/health` | name, version, apiVersion, self, uptime, autoName (`lastRun`) |
| GET | `/api/settings` | apiVersion, self, host names, quick replies |
| GET | `/api/fleet[?local=1]` | `{ self, hosts: [{ name, ok, error?, sessions, spawnDirs, notes? }], snapshotAt }` — sessions are `list --json` objects + `host` (`title` capped at 300 chars) + `editorUrl` (the "Open in editor" link for its cwd, built by the server that answered — see [Session briefs](#session-briefs)); the merged view is a warm background-refreshed snapshot |
| GET | `/api/hosts/:host/sessions/:id/peek?lines=N` | plain-text screen |
| GET | `/api/hosts/:host/sessions/:id/messages?limit=N` | conversation (no tool calls) from the transcript |
| POST | `/api/hosts/:host/sessions/:id/send` | `{ text }` → typed + Enter |
| POST | `/api/hosts/:host/sessions/:id/keys` | `{ key }` (Enter, Escape, …) |
| POST | `/api/hosts/:host/sessions/:id/rename` | `{ title }` (1–64 chars, one line) → `fleet rename <session_id> <title> --json`; 200 with the report, **409** when held (waiting on a prompt, nothing typed), 400 bad title, 502 CLI failure |
| POST | `/api/hosts/:host/spawn` | `{ name?, dir?, prompt? }` → new tmux session running claude; `dir` must resolve inside one of the host's `spawnDirs` (else 400); a prompt too long to type (the launch line over ~900 bytes) is written to `~/.claude/fleet-prompts/` and passed as `"$(cat <file>)"`; when Claude never starts (the pane is still just a shell after ~10s) the tmux session is killed and the answer is 502 with the pane's last lines |
| GET | `/api/hosts/:host/usage[?refresh=1]` | that host's Claude subscription limits: `fleet usage --json` + `host` (see [Subscription usage](#subscription-usage)); 502 with the CLI's reason (no login, endpoint down with nothing cached) |
| GET | `/api/hosts/:host/spawn-dirs` | that host's stored `spawnDirs` (canonical `{ label, paths }`), whether each of its own paths is a directory there, and what it offers now |
| PUT | `/api/hosts/:host/spawn-dirs` | `{ spawnDirs, dryRun? }` → validated on that host (its own paths must exist), written with `fleet --local config set spawnDirs`, used at once (no restart); 400 with per-entry `errors`.

Starts agents, like spawn: **409** `{ error, candidates }` when the target is ambiguous (exit 2), 404 no match (exit 3), 502 `{ error, restored: [], failed }` when nothing came back; a partial `--all` is 200 with `failed` filled. The fleet list (and a stack sync) refresh as the sessions register. Proxy timeout 6 min |
| POST | `/api/hosts/:host/dormant/forget` | `{ target }` or `{ all: true }` → `fleet --local restore (--forget=<target> \| --forget-all) --json` → `{ host, forgotten }`; 409 / 404 as restore |

`:host` is `self` or a configured peer; `:id` is a session id or a unique prefix (≥ 8 chars) — on
the `/stacks/:id` routes a stack id (or anything `fleet stack` resolves). The
full contract (status codes, limits, timeouts) lives with the server: [web/README.md](../web/README.md),
[web/ARCHITECTURE.md](../web/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Smart grouping

The web Board view shows sessions as columns of work streams, and nobody maintains those groups:
`core::grouping` (the `fleet group` verb) does, with one source of truth for the whole fleet.

- **Where it runs.** One host: `grouping.host`, or — without it — the host whose server has
  `web.grouping.enabled`. That server runs `fleet group --input - --apply --json` every
  `web.grouping.intervalMinutes` (default 10, first run 20s after start) with its merged
  `/api/fleet` body on stdin — so it needs no ssh to its peers, only their web servers — and early
  (≥ 2 min after the last run) when the warm snapshot shows live sessions no group knows. Every
  other server proxies `/api/groups` to it (and finds it by asking peers when `grouping.host` is
  unset). The state lives on that host (`~/.local/state/fleet/groups.json`).
- **Input per session**: display name (generated title, else name), name, the last two cwd
  segments (worktree paths carry the branch-ish name; the git branch itself is not read — a
  remote session's branch isn't cheaply known), host, the first prompt's first 160 characters.
  Prompts are capped at 12k characters per call; overflow goes to another call, at most 4 per run.
- **Stability.** Assignments persist per `host/sessionId` with a fingerprint of those inputs; an
  unchanged session is never re-sent. New or changed sessions are classified into the existing
  groups (the model sees their labels and a few member names and is told never to rename them) or
  a new group; a new label equal to an existing one reuses that group. Consolidation — merge
  clearly identical streams, fix a clearly wrong label — runs at most hourly, only after changes,
  and is capped at 2 merges + 2 renames per pass. Group ids never change; empty groups vanish;
  sessions of a host that didn't answer keep their group.
- **Dormant sessions** (left by a reboot, see [Session recovery](#session-recovery)) count as
  present: they keep their assignment (and so their group), are never sent to the model, and come
  back with `"dormant": true` on their member object in a pass's report (`fleet group --json`, and
  so `/api/groups`; absent otherwise, never set by `--cached`). The pass reads this machine's
  snapshot and, for each other answering host, `fleet -H <host> restore --json` — in parallel with
  the session fetch. A host whose dormant list can't be read is treated like a host that didn't
  answer: none of its assignments are pruned that run (a fleet too old to have `restore` has none).
- **Hand edits win.** Renaming a group on the Board locks its label (never renamed, never merged
  away); a session dragged to another group is a `manual` assignment the passes never touch.
  A group made on the Board (`manual`) stays even when empty, until the user deletes it.
  Column order is the UI's (`fleet.boardOrder`, per browser), not part of the state.
- **Fallback.** Model disabled, missing, logged out, or answering garbage (one retry on an
  unparseable answer, none on a failed call): group by repository, marked `fallback`, reclassified
  once the model is back. The UI does the same grouping client-side when no server runs grouping.
- **Cost.** A run with nothing new makes no model call; a typical run after one new session makes
  one (haiku, ~2–8k prompt characters, 10–45s wall clock with `claude -p` start-up).

## Session briefs

A brief is a small markdown doc per session: 1–2 sentences on exactly what the session is doing and
where (repo/cwd, branch, host), every resource it produced, and its todos with progress — enough
to start a **new** session from it and just continue (`continuePrompt` in the API is that first
prompt). The user can edit it; their edits are authoritative.

**Storage.** One file per session on the host the session lives on:
`$FLEET_BRIEFS_DIR/<session_id>.md`, else `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/fleet/briefs/<session_id>.md`
(dir `0700`, files `0600`), always written atomically (temp file + rename). The web server owns
generation (`web/lib/briefs.mjs`); any other reader/writer — `fleet brief` (`core::brief`, a port
of `web/lib/brief-format.mjs` and the PUT rules) — uses the same files and must follow the same
format and merge rules. Both implementations pin the shared fixtures in `testdata/briefs/`
(regenerate the expected outputs from the server code with `node testdata/briefs/gen.mjs`).

**Format** (a contract, like the JSON outputs — add keys freely, never rename or retype one):

## Summary
Fixing the login redirect loop in ~/Code/project on branch fix-login; the fix is in review.

## Resources
- Git: `fix-login` · worktree `~/Code/project-wt`
- PR: [owner/repo#12](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/12)
- File: `src/login.ts`
- Spec: `specs/login/SPEC.md`
- Artifact: [Login report](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/…)
- Link: [docs.example.dev/auth](https://docs.example.dev/auth)

## Todos
- [x] reproduce the loop
- [ ] fix the redirect (in progress)
```

- Frontmatter: `key: value` lines between `---` fences. Numbers are bare, arrays/objects are
  one-line JSON, a string that would read back as another type is a JSON string. Keys:
  `session`, `host`, `cwd` (informational, written by the server); `updated` (last write of any
  kind, ISO 8601); **`generatedThrough`** — the **byte offset** into the session's transcript JSONL
  (`~/.claude/projects/<encoded cwd>/<session_id>.jsonl`) up to which the conversation has been
  summarised, always at a line boundary (a transcript smaller than it was replaced: start over);
  `generatedAt` (last model generation); `editedAt` (last human edit, absent until one);
  `todos` (hash of the todo list last copied into Todos); `dismissed` (resource keys a human
  deleted — never added back; at most 200); `git` (the auto `Git:` line last written; its
  presence also means the legacy `Branch:` / `Worktree:` lines were migrated). Unknown keys are
  preserved.
- Body: exactly three `## ` sections, written in this order — `Summary`, `Resources`, `Todos`.
  Parsers are tolerant: headings case-insensitive, sections in any order or missing, text before
  the first heading and other `## ` sections are kept (written after Todos), `*`/`+` bullets,
  `[X]`. A `## Plan` section (the name before Todos) is read as `## Todos` and written back as
  `## Todos` on the next write.
- Resources: one bullet per item, `- <Kind>: <value>`, value a markdown link `[label](url)` or a
  code span `` `path` ``. Kinds: `PR`, `Issue`, `Artifact`, `Spec`, `File`, `Git`, `Link` (and the
  legacy `Branch`, `Worktree`). Any other bullet (no kind, free text) is a hand-written line and
  kept as is. An item's **key** is its URL (fragment and trailing `/` dropped), else its path
  (`branch:<name>` / `worktree:<path>` for the legacy kinds); every `Git` line has the key `git`.
  Paths are relative to the session's cwd when inside it, else `~/…`, else absolute.
- The **Git line** — one per brief, where the session's checkout is: ``- Git: `<branch>` · worktree
  `<root>` `` for a linked worktree, `` · repo `<root>` `` for the main checkout (`<root>` = the
  checkout root, `~/…`; `detached` in place of the branch). A Git line in exactly this form is the
  auto one and is **replaced in place** when the branch or root changes; with no Git line at all
  one is inserted at the top of Resources unless `git` is in `dismissed` (a human deleted it). A
  Git line in any other form (e.g. with a note appended) is a human's and left alone. Migration:
  before the `git` frontmatter key exists, the server's old auto lines — exactly
  `` - Branch: `<name>` `` / `` - Worktree: `<path>` `` — are dropped on the next write and the Git
  line takes the first one's place; hand-written variants (other bullets, extra text) stay.
- Todos: `- [ ] todo` / `- [x] todo` lines; other lines in the section are kept.

**Merge rules** (every writer): never drop a line a human wrote; new auto items are appended
unless their key is already present or in `dismissed` (the Git line: replaced in place, above); a
human edit (PUT) that removes a resource line adds its key to `dismissed`; the machine keys
(`generatedThrough`, `generatedAt`, `todos`, `dismissed`, `git`) are the writer's, not taken from
an edited body.

**Generation** (hybrid, `web/lib/brief-extract.mjs` + `web/lib/briefs.mjs`):

1. *Resources without a model*, read incrementally from the transcript: files the session wrote
   (Edit / Write / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit targets, shell redirects and `tee`; temp dirs skipped;
   `SPEC.md`, `FINAL.md` and files under `specs/` are `Spec`), PR/issue URLs printed by
   `gh pr|issue create`, artifact URLs returned by an Artifact publish, PR/issue/artifact/other
   links in the assistant's text, PR/issue/artifact links in the user's prompts; the Git line
   (branch, checkout root, linked worktree or not) from one `git rev-parse` in the cwd. Links to this machine or the private network (IP
   literals, dotless or `.local`/`.ts.net` hosts), schema hosts, templated or `…`-truncated URLs are
   dropped. Read-only tool output (a file that lists PRs) never counts.
2. *Todos without a model* when the session keeps todos: the latest `TodoWrite` list, or the task
   list from `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, is the Todos section (rewritten only when the list
   changes, so a hand edit stands until the next todo change).
3. *Summary* (and the Todos when the session keeps none) from `claude -p --model <model>` — flags as in
   `core::naming` (prompt on stdin, `--strict-mcp-config`, tools disallowed, a neutral cwd) plus
   `--no-session-persistence`, 2 min timeout. Input: the current Summary + Todos (≤ `maxBriefChars`)
   and ONLY the conversation since `generatedThrough` — user prompts and turn-ending assistant
   text, each clipped, newest kept, ≤ `maxDeltaChars` — told that hand-edited content is
   authoritative and to update, not rewrite. The answer must be a `## Summary` (≤ 1200 chars) and
   optionally a `## Todos` of checkboxes (`## Plan` is accepted too); anything else keeps the old brief. An edit that lands
   while the model runs wins (the answer is discarded).

**Budget** — model calls are what costs, so every automatic one has to pass all of:

- the session is `idle` or `waiting`, and has been for `idleMs` (registry `updated_at`);
- its transcript grew past `generatedThrough` by ≥ `minNewTurns` user prompts or ≥
  `minNewChars` characters of conversation;
- ≥ `minIntervalMs` since that session's last call (a gated update stays pending and runs when the
  gate opens, without needing more growth);
- no other brief call is running on this host (one at a time), and fewer than
  `maxCallsPerHour` calls in the last hour.

The background pass checks this host's live sessions every 30 s (the 2 s discovery cache — no
extra `fleet list` while a UI is polling) and forgets sessions that are gone. Resource and todo
extraction (no model) runs whenever the transcript grew — in the background pass and on GET. A
manual regenerate skips the idle, interval and new-content gates (with nothing new it re-reads the
recent conversation) but waits for the one-at-a-time slot and counts against the hourly cap. Each
call is logged with its input size (`[briefs] idle 1a2b3c4d: claude -p --model haiku, 12 msg(s) /
3 user turn(s), 8123 chars in (4/12 this hour)`); `/api/health` reports `briefs: { enabled, model,
callsLastHour, maxCallsPerHour, generating, lastRun }`.

**Open in editor.** GET/PUT brief bodies carry `absCwd` (the session's directory on its host,
absolute, no `~`), `gitRoot` (the checkout root — repo or linked worktree — containing it, absolute;
null outside git), `editor` (`web.editor` of the answering server) and `editorUrl`; session rows in
`/api/fleet` carry `editorUrl` for their cwd. `worktrees` lists the git checkouts the session works
in — `[{ path, display, branch, linked, editorUrl }]`, the cwd's first, then the checkouts of the
directories the transcript records the session in (its entries' `cwd`, kept in the brief's `dirs`
frontmatter key) and of the File / Spec resources; a directory's checkout is the nearest ancestor
with a `.git`, deduped by root — each with its own `editorUrl`. The link targets `gitRoot`, else `absCwd`:
`vscode://file/<path>` when the session is on the machine the browser runs on, else
`vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+<hosts.<host>.ssh><path>` (Remote-SSH with **that** server's ssh
alias for the host). The browser's machine is read from the request: a loopback address is the
answering server's own host, an address equal to a host's `web` url hostname is that host, anything
else (a phone) is none of them. For a session on the answering server's own host seen from another
machine the ssh destination is `web.editorSsh`, else `<server user>@<the hostname the browser
used>`. `cursor://…` alike for `web.editor: "cursor"`; `null` when `web.editor` is null,
there is no absolute path, or the host has no usable `ssh` alias. A proxied request is answered by
the peer (which knows only its own absolute paths) and the server that received it fills in
`editor` / `editorUrl` from its own config and the request's address.
`fleet brief <target> --open` does the same from the CLI: `code <path>` here, `code --remote
ssh-remote+<ssh dest> <path>` for a session on another host (`cursor` with `web.editor: "cursor"`).

## Session stacks

A **stack** is N Claude Code sessions on one host sharing one context layer: a markdown file,
the **StackBrief**. Any session can spawn a *sibling* (`fleet stack spawn`, the web UI's "Spawn
sibling"); the sibling joins the source's stack, which is created around the source first when
it has none. Every session spawned into a stack starts with the **context line**:

```
You're running in the session stack with shared context: <abs path to the stack file>. <prompt>
```

(nothing after the period when the prompt is empty; `core::stack::context_line` /
`stack_prompt`, and `contextLine` in every `--json` output so the web server prepends the same
text). The StackBrief is generated once, at creation; after that it is maintained by scripts
(membership) and by hand. Logic: `core::stack`; CLI: `fleet stack` ([cli.md](cli.md#stacks));
the web server only shells out to `fleet --local stack … --json` and never parses the markdown.

**Storage.** `$FLEET_STACKS_DIR`, else `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/fleet/stacks/`, one
`<stack_id>.md` per stack (dir `0700`, files `0600`, atomic temp + rename writes). The file is
the state — no index; "which stack is session X in" scans the dir. Stack id: `st-` + 8 random
lowercase hex, never changes. A stack lives on the host where its file is; its members are
sessions of that host (`host` on members is for later — v1 never mixes hosts).

**Format** (a contract: add keys freely, never rename or retype one):

```markdown

## Summary
2–4 sentences on the stack as a whole: what, and where (repo, branch/worktree, host).

## Resources
- Git: `fix-login` · worktree `~/Code/project-wt`
- PR: [owner/repo#12](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/12)
- Folder: `~/Code/project`

## Sessions
- **login-redirect** (`1a2b3c4d`, live) — added 2026-09-29 10:00 · brief `~/.local/state/fleet/briefs/<uuid>.md` · transcript `~/.claude/projects/<encoded cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`
  first prompt: "Fix the login redirect loop"

## Notes
free text; any other `## ` section is kept as is
```

- Frontmatter: the briefs' encoding (`key: value`, arrays/objects one-line JSON). Machine keys —
  `stack`, `host`, `cwd`, `created`, `updated` (last write of any kind), `generatedAt` (the model
  wrote Summary/Resources), `editedAt` (last human edit), `members` — are never taken from an
  edited body; `label` is (from the submitted frontmatter). Unknown keys are preserved.
- `members[]`: `{ session, host, name, added, closed, cwd?, firstPrompt? }` — `name` is the
  display title at the last sync, `closed` `null` while live and an ISO time once the session was
  seen gone (members are never removed automatically; `fleet stack remove` does), `cwd` (`~/…`)
  and `firstPrompt` (≤ 160 chars) are kept so the Sessions line survives the session. Unknown
  member keys are preserved.
- Body: the header blockquote and `## Sessions` are **regenerated** on every machine write
  (Sessions from `members`: `live` / `closed <date>`, the brief path whether or not it exists, the
  transcript path for the member's cwd, `first prompt:` when known; dates UTC). `Summary`,
  `Resources`, `Notes` and any other section, and text above the first heading, are a human's
  and kept verbatim. Parsing is tolerant like briefs (case-insensitive headings, any order,
  missing sections); Resources bullets parse like a brief's (`parse_resource_line`; `Folder:`
  lines get the kind `Folder`).
- Human edit (`fleet stack set` / `edit`, web PUT): the submitted body is authoritative except
  for the header and Sessions; machine keys are the stored file's; `editedAt` + `updated`
  stamped; `--expect-updated` / `expectUpdated` refuses a stale edit (CLI exit 3, HTTP 409). At
  most 64 kB.

**Membership sync** (`core::stack::sync`, no model): for every stack file on this host, a member
whose session id is not among the live sessions gets `closed = now` (once); a live one gets its
`name` refreshed from `display_title` (and `closed` cleared — a resumed session). Only files
whose members changed are rewritten. It runs in `fleet stack list` / `show` / `sync` and after
`spawn` / `add` / `remove`; the web server runs `stack sync` after a kill and every
`web.stacks.syncMinutes` while any session is in a stack. Nothing is marked closed when the
session registry can't be read, and a member dormant on this machine (left by a reboot,
`snapshot::dormant_session_ids`) is not marked closed either — it is left as it was. StackView
members carry `dormant: true|false` next to `live` (dormant = not live and in this machine's
dormant set). `fleet list` only stamps `stack: { id, label } | null` on each
row (read-only).

**Generation** (creation only; `stacks.model`, default `sonnet`): one `core::naming::ask_claude`
call (`-p --model <m> --strict-mcp-config`, tools disallowed, prompt on stdin, neutral cwd, 120 s)
with the source session's display title, cwd, host, its Git line (`git rev-parse` in the cwd),
first prompt, its session brief's body when there is one, and the last ~6000 characters of its
conversation (user prompts and turn-ending assistant text, main thread, tool blocks skipped).
The answer must be `Label: <2–5 words>`, `## Summary` (≤ 1000 chars, generalised to the stack)
and `## Resources` (`- Kind: value` bullets of things really in the input); the Git line and a
Folder line are added when missing. Anything unparseable, a failed call, `--no-llm`,
`FLEET_FIXTURE` or `stacks.enabled: false` → the skeleton (Summary "Started from <title> in
<cwd>.", Resources = Git line + Folder): a model failure never blocks creating the stack
(`generated: false` and a `warning`). There is no regeneration after creation (v1).

## Session recovery

After a reboot fleet shows what was running as **dormant** and brings it back on demand: the same
tmux session name, windows, panes and cwds, every Claude pane re-launched with
`<launcher> <flags> --resume <sessionId>`. The session id is unchanged by `--resume` (only
`--fork-session` mints a new one), so groups, stacks and briefs — all keyed by session id — carry
over. Code: `core::snapshot` (no printing); CLI: `fleet restore` and `fleet enter`
([cli.md](cli.md#session-recovery)).

### `snapshot.json`

One per machine: `$FLEET_SNAPSHOT`, else `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/fleet/snapshot.json`
(dir `0700`, file `0600`, written atomically under a `snapshot.json.lock` file lock). Unknown keys
are preserved at every level on rewrite — it is a contract like `groups.json`.

```json
{
  "version": 1, "host": "laptop", "bootId": "1727000000", "updatedAt": "2026-10-04T12:00:00Z",
  "tmux":  [ TmuxSnap… ],
  "iterm": [ ClaudeSnap… ],
  "dormant": { "tmux": [ TmuxSnap… ], "iterm": [ ClaudeSnap… ] },
  "closed":  { "tmux": [ TmuxSnap… ], "claude": [ ClaudeSnap… ] }
}
TmuxSnap   = { name, windows: [ { index, name, layout, active, autoName,
                                  panes: [ { index, cwd, active, claude: ClaudeSnap|null } ] } ],
               since?, goneAt?, closedAt? }
ClaudeSnap = { sessionId, name, cwd, title, flags: [argv…], since?, goneAt?, closedAt?, tmuxSession? }
```

- `tmux` — the live tmux sessions of the current boot; `iterm` — live Claude sessions that are
  not in a tmux pane fleet can see (iTerm, unknown). `dormant` — what earlier boots ran.
  `closed` — what ended within a boot ([Recently closed](#recently-closed)); added later, so a
  file without it is an empty list. A session id is never both dormant and closed.
- `layout` is `#{window_layout}`; `autoName` = tmux named the window itself (a restore then
  leaves the name to tmux). `title` is the display title when recorded. `flags` is the
  replay-safe part of the Claude command line (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--chrome`,
  `--model`, `--permission-mode`, `--add-dir`, `--agent`, `--fallback-model`; `--k=v` is
  normalised to `--k v`).
- `since` (dormant entries) — when it went down: the old boot's last `updatedAt`. An unchanged
  snapshot is still rewritten every 10 minutes so this stays accurate.
- `goneAt` (live entries) — it vanished this long ago; after 5 minutes it moves into `closed`. A
  restart quits the terminal apps (and the Claude sessions in them) before it kills the daemons,
  and a poll in between must not erase them; a Claude session gone from a pane that is still there
  lingers in that pane, one whose pane is gone lingers in `iterm` (with `tmuxSession`).
- `closedAt` (closed entries) — when it ended (its `goneAt`). `tmuxSession` — the tmux session a
  Claude session ran in, kept when it left its pane (`/exit`, the shell stayed).
- `bootId` — `$FLEET_BOOT_ID` (tests), else Linux `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id`, else macOS
  `kern.boottime` seconds. Unknown → nothing is ever marked dormant.

**Recording** happens on every local `fleet list` with a successful discovery (one `tmux
list-panes -a`, one `ps` for the Claude pids), never in fixture mode, never when tmux fails for a
reason other than "no server", and only writes when something changed. Rules: a stored boot id
different from the current one moves the stored `tmux`/`iterm` into `dormant` (merged by tmux name
/ session id); then `tmux`/`iterm` become the live state; a dormant Claude session that is live
again (resumed by hand) leaves `dormant` (inside a dormant tmux session its pane becomes a plain
shell), and a dormant tmux session left with no dormant Claude pane whose name is live again is
dropped. Readers that do not record (the `watch` header, `fleet tmux list`, the `list` footer)
apply a pending reboot in memory; `fleet restore` and the dormant lookup of `fleet enter` record
first, so the first command after a reboot already sees the old boot as dormant.

**For other views** (groups, stacks, the web Board): `core::snapshot::dormant_session_ids()` is the
set of this machine's dormant session ids; for another host, `fleet -H <host> restore --json` and
the `sessionId`s under `dormant[].sessions`. A dormant session counts as *present*, not gone:
grouping keeps its assignment and flags the member `dormant: true` ([Smart
grouping](#smart-grouping)); stack sync doesn't close it and StackView members carry `dormant`.

### Recently closed

A session that ends *within* a boot — Close in the app, `fleet kill`, `/exit`, a killed tmux
session — is **closed**, deliberately separate from dormant: it is never part of `restore --all`,
`restore.onBoot`, `fleet enter`'s auto-restore, `dormant_session_ids()` or the groups'/stacks'
dormant sets, so a closed session's group and stack membership lapses as before. It can still be
brought back by hand for `restore.keepClosedDays` (default 7; `0` = off), the newest 50 at most.

- It shows as closed at once: `core::snapshot::closed_entries` is the stored `closed` lists plus
  whatever still lingers with `goneAt`. When the grace period ends it moves into `closed`
  (`closedAt` = its `goneAt`); a reboot within the grace period makes it dormant instead (and it
  leaves the closed list). Older closed entries stay closed across a reboot (expiry still applies).
- Whole tmux sessions are kept only when they had a Claude pane; plain shell sessions are not. A
  Claude session that exits while its tmux pane lives on is a lone closed entry with
  `tmuxSession`.
- A closed (or dormant) Claude session whose id is live again leaves the list; a closed tmux
  session left with no Claude pane goes. A newer closed tmux session of the same name replaces
  the older one, whose Claude sessions stay as lone entries.
- Restore (`fleet restore --closed <target>`) is the dormant restore: a tmux session with its
  layout (non-Claude panes a plain shell), a lone Claude session in a new tmux session named
  after its title — except one with a `tmuxSession` that still exists, which gets a new window
  (`new-window -d`) there running the resume line. Same launcher, flags, name-clash handling,
  dry run, file lock and exit codes (2 ambiguous, 3 no match).

## Extension points

- **Another web UI.** The HTTP API is the contract; point `web.ui` (or `FLEET_WEB_UI`) at a
  directory with its own `index.html` and it is served same-origin with `/api/*`, or build a
  separate app against the same API.
- **A different TUI or native app.** Link the core library (`fleet::core`) directly, or shell out
  to `fleet list --json` and the other commands.
- **Integrations** (notifications, chat bots, status bars): poll `fleet list --all-hosts --json`
  or `GET /api/fleet`; act through `fleet send` / `POST …/send`. Treat anything that can send as
  having the agent's full permissions.
- **New backends** (another terminal emulator): implement discovery matching (tty → handle) and
  the control operations in `core::backend`; everything above picks it up.
- **The Claude Code skill** (`fleet skill install`) teaches an agent to use `fleet` itself —
  e.g. to hand work off to another session.
